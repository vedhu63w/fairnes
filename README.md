Fairness in ML

This contains the implementation of making Machine Leanring algorithm fair. There are two methods in the implementation. First method is fair-PCA which first applies
PCA and then does post processing to reduce the discrimination. Second method modifies the cost function in the Logistic Regression to design Fair-Logistic Regression.
